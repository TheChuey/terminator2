app/tools/state.py
==================

Shared working state for the file-management tools.

The FileSession is the single in-memory record of everything a file-aware
agent has discovered, read, written, or proposed for deletion during the
current process. It lets later tool calls (and the model itself) build on
previous results instead of re-scanning the filesystem each turn.

The session is process-wide: one instance is created lazily and shared by
every agent that is built in this process.

It is injected into the conversation by Agent._inject_session_context and
hydrated from tool results by the _record_result wrapper in app/agents/factory.py.
